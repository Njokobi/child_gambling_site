        <ul align="center" class="noto-sans-thin">
            <li><h3>Parental Action</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Parents can restrict children's usage of the internet. Internet use has the consequence of allowing a developing child to access near limitless information on many subjects
                There are gambling sites like Stake.com that actively advertize using streamers which children commonly watch. The wins that these streamers get and their reactions stimulates a child's brain.
                This leads to the child wanting to be like them, being constantly happy. The child subsequently signs up for the site and gambles away, oblivious to the consequences. Parents supervising
                their kids' internet use helps this by preventing the kids from accessing these websites in the first place, nipping the problem at the bud.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Government Intervention</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Legislation could be tightened on gambling applications to require verification each time the application is started. This would mean that each time a child wishes to
                gamble, they would need an ID. Even if this ID is fake, the sheer amount of times that the child needs to input this information would increase their chances of getting caught.
                Otherwise, the photo of the ID could be referenced thouroughly with the database of persons in the country to confirm if the ID is real. The increase in scrutiny here would result in more
                child accounts being found and properly dealt with. These accounts would be flagged for deletion and the owner of the card or bitcoin wallet would be notified of the misuse happening on their card/wallet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Civilian Action</h3>
                <p>Us civilians have a role in this as well. We can work against these sites that try to prey upon children. In the game Minecraft, people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDuperTrooper">DuperTrooper</a> attempt to conduct
                this form of resistance. He attempts to crash the economy of or just crash Minecraft servers which use lootboxes, which are basically roulette tables, that are paid for with real world money.
                He prevents the children from even coming to this virtual casino within the game Minecraft or makes it useless to continue gambling as everyone has everyting for free. This hurts the wallets of
                the server owners, giving the duper/crasher a more palpable form of retribution compared to the disconnected feelings associated with Government Intervention and Parental Action

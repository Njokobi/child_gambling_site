                	Child gambling is a rampant problem in our society. It allows thousands of children each year to use fake IDs and gamble on their allowance and any money they can find. 
                    Nevertheless it seems to be a forgotten issue in today's landscape. Online, gambling is being glorified by the content creators watched by kids such as the likes of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-xqc-reveals-wagered-2-9-billion-gambling-stake" target="_blank">xQc</a> 
                    or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1gskdy0/kai_cenat_promoting_gambling_during_his_subathon/" target="_blank">Kai Cenat</a> and pushed through games like Roblox or Minecraft. The children, wishing to revel in the enjoyment seen in gambling, flock to games like Minecraft or Roblox 
                    to play on servers which have the gambling air to them. By playing on these servers while using their lootbox mechanics, the brains of adolescents are manipulated into loving 
                    the degrading practice of gambling. As a child gambles, the risk of having gambling problems later in their life increases. It could also give a negative connotation to the 
                    practice if the child does not experience success in their endeavour. Just over a quarter of 11 to 17 year olds had spent their own money on gambling in the UK during a six 
                    month timeframe in 2023 (<a href=”https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/young-people-and-gambling-2023” target="_blank">gamblingcommission.gov</a>) which serves to prove the rampant nature of 
                    gaming amongst minors. 3 in 10 young people have seen family members gamble (<a href=”https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/young-people-and-gambling-2023” target="_blank">gamblingcommission.gov</a>), further adding to the negative 
                    reinforcement pushed by the role models in a child's life. The best prevention for gambling is simple: Don’t Start. Teach a child young and they WILL stay away. The heart may waver but the brain will keep it in check.
